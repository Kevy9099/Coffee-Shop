        <p class="text-justify fs-5">Every morning began the same way the soft patter of paws on the kitchen floor,
          the smell of freshly brewed coffee, and the sound of laughter echoing through the house. Olive, our family
          chocolate lab,
          would curl up beside us as we planned our days and dreamed our dreams. It was during one of those quiet
          mornings that the idea for Olive&rsquo;s House Coffee Co. was born.

        <p class="text-justify fs-5">For Kevin and Rubi, coffee was never just a drink — it was a ritual, a connection,
          a way to slow down and share life&rsquo;s small moments. Their daughter, Sophia,
          often joined in, doodling café logos on napkins and naming imaginary drinks after their family dog, Olive.
          When Olive passed, her absence left more than just silence — it left a longing to keep her warmth alive.
          She had been the heart of their home: loyal, gentle, and always ready to welcome friends with a wag and a
          smile.
          So, they decided to open a café in her memory — a place that felt like Olive herself: warm, welcoming, and
          full of heart.</p>

        <p class="text-justify fs-5">Today, Olive&rsquo;s House Coffee Co. stands as a tribute to that love and to every
          wagging tail, every shared laugh, and every cup of coffee that brings people
          together. Inside, you&rsquo;ll find the aroma of freshly roasted beans, the hum of quiet conversation, and a
          sense that you&rsquo;re not just visiting a café —
          you&rsquo;revisiting home.</p>

        <p class="text-justify fs-5">Because here, every cup tells a story.</p>
        <p class="text-justify fs-5">And this one started with Olive.</p>
